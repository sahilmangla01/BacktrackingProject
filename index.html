    <h1>Backtracking</h1>
    <p>Backtracking is a form of recursion.</p>
    <p>
      The usual scenerio is that you are faced with a number of options, and you
      must choose one of those. After you make your choice you will get a new
      set of options; just what set of options you get depends on what choice
      you made. This procedure is repeated over and over until you reach a final
      state. If you made a good sequence of choices, your final state is a goal
      state;' if you didn't, it isn't.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conceptually, you start at the root of a tree; the tree probably has some
      good leaves and some bad leaves ,though it may be that the leaves are all
      good or all bad. You want to get to a leaf. At each node, beginning with
      the root, you choose one of its children to move to, and you keep this up
      until you get to a leaf.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose you get to a bad leaf. You can backtrack to continue the search
      for a good leaf by revoking your most recent choice, and trying out the
      next option in that set of options. If you run out of options, revoke the
      choice that got you here, and try another choice at that node. If you end
      up at the rootwith no options left, there are no good leaves to be found.
    </p>
    <p>This needs an example.</p>
    <img src="./Images/Image_root.png" alt="Root Image" height="200" />
    <ol>
      <li>Starting at the Root, your options are A and B. You cchoose A.</li>
      <li>At A, your options are C and D. You choose C.</li>
      <li>C is bad. go back to A.</li>
      <li>At A, you have already tried C, and it failed. Try D.</li>
      <li>D is bad. Go back to A.</li>
      <li>At A, you have no options left to try. Go back to Root.</li>
      <li>At Root you have already tried A. Try B.</li>
      <li>At B, your options are E and F. Try E.</li>
      <li>E is good. Congratulations!</li>
    </ol>
    <p style="background-color: #EDEDED;">
      In this example we drew a picture of a tree. the tree is an abstract model
      of the possible sequences of the choices we could make. There is also a
      data structure called a tree, but usually we don't have a data structure
      to tell us what choices we have. (If we have an actual tree data
      structure, backtracking on it is called depth-first tree searching.)

    <h3>The backtracking algorithm.</h3>
    <pre  style= "color: #007EB4;  ">
      boolean solve(Node n){
        if n is a leaf node{
        if the leaf is a goal node, return true 
        else return false 
      }else{ 
          for each child c of n{ 
            if solve(c) succeeds, return true 
          } 
          return false 
        } 
      }
    </pre>

    <p style="background-color: #EDEDED;">
      Notice that the algorithm is expressed as a boolean function. This is
      essential to understanding the algorithm. If solve(n) is true, that means
      node n is part of a solution--taht is, node n is one of the nodes on a
      path from the root to some goal node. We say that n is solvable. If
      solve(n) is false, then there is no path that includes n to any goal node.
    </p>
    <p><strong>How does this work?</strong></p>
    <ul style="text-align: left">
      <li>If any child of n is solvable, then n is solvable.</li>
      <li>If no child of n is solvable, then n is not solvable.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Hence, to decide whether any non-leaf node n is solve (part of a path to a
      goal node), all you have to do is test weather any child of n is solvable.
      This is done recursively, on each child of n. In the above cod, this is
      done by the lines.
    </p>
    <pre style="color: #007EB4">
      for each child c of n{ 
        if solve(c) succeeds, return true 
      } 
      return false
    </pre>

    <p>
      Eventually the recursion eill "bottom" out at a leaf node is a goal node,
      it is solvable; if the leaf node is not a goal node, it is not solvable.
      This is our base case. In the above code, this is done by the lines
    </p>
    <pre style="color: #007EB4">
      if n is a leaf node{ 
        if the leaf is a goal node, return true 
        else return false 
      }
    </pre>
    <p>
      The backtracking algorithm is simple but important. You should understand
      it thoroughly. Another way of stating it is as follows:
    </p>
    <h3>. To search a tree:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        If the tree consists of a single leaf, test weather it is a goal node.
      </li>
      <li>
        Otherwise, search the subtrees until you find one containing a goal
        node, or until you have searched them all unsuccessfully.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Non-recursive backtracking, using a stack</h3>
    <p>
      Backtracking is a rather typical recursive algorithm, and any recursive
      algorithm can be rewritten as a stack algorithm. In fact, that is how your
      recursive algorithms are translated into machine or assembly language.
    </p>
    <pre style="color: #007EB4;">
      boolean solve(Node n) { 
        put node n on the stack; 
          while the stack is not empty { 
            if the node at the top of the stack is a leaf {
              if it is goal node, return true 
                else pop it off the stack 
          } 
            else { 
              if the node at the top of the stack has untried children 
                push the next untried child onto the stack 
              else pop the node off the stack 


          } 
          return false 
        } 

      } 
    </pre>
      <p>Starting from the root, the only nodes that can be pushed onto the stack are the children of the node currently on the top of the 
        stack, and these are only pushed on one child at a time; hence the nodes on the stack at all times describe a valid path in the 
        tree. Nodes are removed from the stack only when it is known that they have no goal nodes among their descendents. Threrfore, 
        if the root node gets removed (making the stack empty), there must have been no goal nodes at all, and no solution to the problem.
      </p>
      <p>When the stack algorithm terminates successfully, the nodes on the stack form (in reverse order) a path from the root to a goal node.</p>
      <p> Similarly, when the recursive algorithm finds a goal node, the path information is embodied (in reverse order) in the sequrnce of
        recursive calls. thus as the recursion unwinds, the path can be recovered one node at a time, by (for instance) printing the node 
        at the current level, or storing it in an array.
      </p>
      <p>Here is the recurssive backtracking algorithm, modified slightly to print (in reverse order) the nodes along the successful path:</p>
      <pre style="color: #007EB4;">
        boolean solve(Node n ){ 
          if n is a leaf node{
            if the leaf is a  good node{ 
              print n 
              return true 
            } 
            else return false 
          } else { 
            for each chid c of n{ 
              if solve(c) succeeds{ 
                print n 
                return true  
              } 
            } 
            return false 
          } 
        }
      </pre>
      <h3>Keeping backtracking simple</h3>
    <p>
      All of these versions of the backtracking algorithm are pretty simple, but when applied 
      to a real problem, they can get pretty cluttered up with details. Even determining whether the nodes is a leaf can be complex:
    </p>
    <p>for example, if the path represents a series of moves in a class endgame problem, the leaves are the checkmate and stalemate solutions </p>
    <p>
      To keep the program clean, therefore tests like this should be buried in methods. In a chess game, for example, you could test
      whether a node is a leaf by writing a <strong>gameOvermethod</strong>(or you could even call it <strong>isLeaf).</strong> This method would encapsulate all the 
      ugly datails of figuring out whether ant possible moves remain. 
    </p>
    <p >
      Notice that the backtracking algorithm require us to keep track, for each node on the current path, which of its children have
      been tried already (so we don't have to try them again). In the above code we made this look simple, by just saying <strong>for each child c of n.</strong>
      In reality it may be difficult to figure out what the possible children are and there may be no obvious way to step through them. In chess, for example a node 
      can repreesent one arrangement of pieces on a chessboard, and each child of that node can represent the arrangement after some piece has made a legal move. How do you find these children 
      , and how do you keep track of which one's you have already examined?
    </p>
    <p>
      The most straighforward way to keep track of which children of the node have been tried is as follows: Upon initial entry to 
      the node (that is, when you firstget there fromm above), makes a list of all its children. As you try each child, take it off the list. 
      When the list is empty, there are no remaining untried children, and you can return "failure". This is a simple approach, but it may require 
      quite a lot of additional work.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is an easier way to keep track of which children have been tried, if you can define an ordering on the children. If there is an 
      ordering, and you know ehich child you just tried, you can determine whic child to try next.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, you might be able to number the <strong>children 1 through n,</strong> and try them in numerical order. Then, if you have just tried 
      <strong>child k,</strong> you know that you have already tried children 1 through <strong>k-1,</strong> and you have not yet tried children <strong>k+1</strong> through <b>n.</b>
       Or, if you are trying to color a map with just four colors, you can always try <strong>red first, then yellow, then green, then blue.</strong> If child yellow fails, you Know to try child green next. 
       If you are searching a maze, you can try choices in the order left, straight, right <strong>(or perhaps north, east, south, west).</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      It isn't always easy to find a simple way to order the children of an node. <strong>In the chess game example,  </strong>you might number your  pieces (or perhaps the square of the board) and try themin numerical
      order; but in addition each piece may also have several moves, and these must also be ordered.
    </p><br>
  <h3>Example: Tree Search</h3>
  <p> 
   For starters, let's do the simplest possible example of backtracking, which is searching an actual tree. We will also use the simplest kind of tree, a binary tree
  </p>
  <p>
    A binary tree is a data structure composed of nodes. One node is designated as the root. Each node can refrence (point to), zero, one, or two other nodes, which 
    are called its children. The children are referred to as the left child and/or the right child. All nodes are reachable (by one or more steps) from the root node, and 
    there are no cycles. For our purposes, although this is not part of the definition of a binary tree, we will say that a node might or might not be a goal node, and will contain its name.
    The first example in this paper (which we repeat here) shows a binary tree. 
  </p>
  <p>Here's a definition of the Binary Tree Class:</p>
  <pre style="color: #007EB4;">
    public class BinaryTree{ 
      BinaryTree leftChild = null; 
      BinaryTree rightChild = null; 
      boolean isGoalNode = false; 
      String name; 


      BinaryTree(String name, BinaryTree left, Binary tree right, boolean isGoalNode){ 
        this.name = name; 
        leftChild = left ; 
        rightChild = right; 
        this.isGoalNode = isGoalNode; 
      } 
    }
  </pre>
  <p>Next we will create a TreeSearch class, and in it we will define a method makeTree() which constructs the above binary tree. </p>
  <pre style="color: #007EB4;">
    static BinaryTree makeTree(){
      BinaryTree root,a,b,c,d,e,f; 
      c= new BinaryTree("C", null, null, false);
      d= new BinaryTree("D", null, null, false); 
      e= new BinaryTree("E", null, null, true); 
      f= new BinaryTree("F", null, null, false); 
      a= new BinaryTree("A", c, d, false); 
      b= new BinaryTree("B", e, f, false); 
      root = newBinaryTree("Root", a, b, false); 
      return root; 
     }
  </pre>
  <p>Here's a main program to create a binary tree and try to solve it:</p>
  <pre style="color: #007EB4;">
    public class void main(String args[]){ 
      BinaryTree tree = makeTree(); 
      System.out.println(solvable(tree)); 
    } 
  </pre>
  <p> And finally, here's the recrusive backtracking routine to "solve" the binary tree by finding a goal node.</p>
  <pre style="color: #007EB4;">
    static boolean solvable(Binarytree node){ 
      /* 1 */ if (node == null) return false; 
      /* 2 */ if(node.isGoalNode) return true; 
      /* 3 */ if(solvable(node.leftChild)) return true; 
      /* 4 */ if(solvable(node.rightChild)) return true; 
      /* 5 */ return false; 
    }
  </pre>
  <p>Here's what the numbered line are doing: </p>
  <ol>
    <li>If we are given a null node, it's not solvable. This statement is so that we can call this method with the children of a node, without
      frist checking whether those children actually exist.
    </li>
    <li>If the node we are given is the goal node, return success.</li>
    <li>See if the left child of node is solvable, and if so, conclude that node is solvable. We will only get to this line if node is non-null and 
      is not a goal node, says to
    </li>
    <li>Do the same thing for the right child.</li>
    <li>Since neither child of node is solvable, node itself is not solvable</li>
  </ol>
  <p>This program runs correctly and produces the unenlightening results true. <br><br>
  Each time we ask for another node, we have to check if it is null. In the above we put that check as the first thing is solvable. An alternative would 
  be to check first whether each child exists, and recur only if they do. Here's that alternaative version:
  </p>

  <pre style="color: #007EB4;">
    static boolean solvable(BinaryTree ndoe){ 
      if(node.isGoalNode) return true; 
      if(node.leftChild!= null && solvable(node.leftChild)) rteurm true; 
      if(node.rightChild!= null && solvable(node.rightChild)) rteurm true; 
      return false; 
    }
  </pre>
  <p>I think thw first version is simple, but the second version is slightly more efficient.</p><hr>
  <h3>What are the Children?</h3>
  <p>
    One of the things that simplifies the above binary tree search is that, at each choice point, you can ignore all the previous choices.
    Previous choices don't give you any information about what you should do next; as far as you know, both the left and the right child are 
    possible solutions . In many problems, however , you may be able to eliminate children immediately, without recursion. <br>
    <br> Consider, for example, the problem of four-coloring a map. It is a theorem of mathematics that any map on a plane, no matter how convoluted
    the countries are, can be colored with atmost four colors, so that no two countries that share a border are the same color. <br><br>
    To color a map, you choose a color for the first country, then a color for the second country, and so on, until all countries are colored. <br><br>
    There are two ways to do this: <br> 
    <ul>
      <li>Method 1. Try each of the four possible colors, and recur. When you run out of countries, check whether you are at a  goal node.</li>
      <li>Method 2. Try only those colors that have not already been used for an adjacent country, and recur. If and when you run out of countries, you have successfully colored the map.</li>
    </ul>
    Let's apply each of these two methods to the problem of coloring a checkerboard. This should be easily solvable; after all, a checkerboard only needs two colors.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>boolean maplsOK()</strong> <br>
    Used by method 1 to check (at a left node) whether the entire map is colored correctly. <br><br>
    <strong>boolean okToColor(int row, int colomn, int color)</strong><br>
    Used by method 2 to check, at every node, whether there is an adjacent node already colored with the given color. <br> <br>
    <strong>int[] nextRowAndColumn(int row, int column)</strong><br>
    Used by both methods tp find the next "country" (actually, the row and column of the next square on the checkerboard). <br><br>
    Here's the code for method 1: 

  </p>
  <pre style="color:#007EB4">
    boolean explore1(int row, int column, int color){ 
      if(row >= NUM_ROWS)return maplsOK(); 
      map[row][column] = color; 
      for(int nextColor = RED; nextColor <= BLUE; nextColor++) {
        int[] next = nextRowAndColumn(row , column); 
        if(explore1(next[0], next[1], nextColor)) return true; 
    } 
      return false;
  }
  </pre>
  <p>And here's the code for method 2:</p>
  <pre style="color: #007EB4;">
    boolean explore2(int row, int column, int color){ 
      if(row >= NUM_ROWS) return true; 
      if(okToColor(row, column, color)){ 
        map[row][column] = color; 
        for(int nextColor = RED; nextColor <= BLUE; nextColor++) {
          int[] next = nextRowAndColumn(row , column); 
          if(explore2(next[0], next[1], nextColor)) return true; 
      } 
    } 
    return false; 
  }
  </pre>
  <p>Those appear pretty similar, and you might think they are equally good. However, the timing information suggests otherwise:</p>
  <center>
  <table border="2">
    <tr>
      <th>  </th>
      <th style="background-color: #858585">2 by 3 map</th>
      <th style="background-color: #858585">3 by 3 map</th>
      <th style="background-color: #858585">3 by 4 map</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th style="background-color: #858585">Mathod 1: </th>
      <td>60 ms</td>
      <td>940 ms</td>
      <td>60530 ms.(1 minute)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th style="background-color: #858585">Method 2:</th>
      <td>0 ms</td>
      <td>0 ms</td>
      <td>0 ms</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</center>
<p>
  The zeros in the above indicate times too short to mesure (less than 1 miliseconds). Why this huge differences? Either of
  these methods could have exponential growth. Eliminating a node automatically eliminates all of its descendents, and this will 
  often prevent exponential growth. Conversely, by waiting to check until a leaf node is reached, exponential growth is practically
  guaranteed. If there is any way to eliminate children (reduce the set of choices), do so!  
</p><hr>

<h3>Debugging techniques</h3>
<p>Often our first try at a program doesn't work, and we need to debug it. Debuggers are helpful, but sometimes we need too fall
  back on inserting print statements. There are some simple tricks to making effective use of print statements. These tricks can be
  applied to any program, but are espically useful when you are trying to debug recursive routines. <br><br>

  <strong>Trick #1 Indent when you print method entries and exists.</strong> <br><br>
  Often, the best debugging technique is to print every method call and return (or at least the most important ones). You probably
  want to print, for each method, what parameters it came in with value it leaves with. However, if you just print a long list of these,
  it's hard to match up method exists with their corresponding entries. Indenting to show the level of nesting can help. <br><br>

  <strong>Trick #2: Use specialized print methods for debugging</strong> <br><br>
  Don't clutter up your actual code more than you must. Also, remember that code inserted for debugging purposes can itself contain bugs, or 
  (in the worst case) can affect the results, so be very careful with it. <br><br>
  Here's our debugging code. For this trival program, there's almost more debugging code than actual code, but in larger programs the proportions will be better.

</p>
<pre style="color: #007EB4;">
  static String indent ="" 

  static String name(BinaryTree node){ 
    if(node == null) return null; 
    else return node.name;
  }

  static void enter(BinaryTree node){ 
    System.out.println(indent + "Entering solvable(" +name(node) + ")"); 
    indent = indent + "| ";
  } 

  static boolean yes(BinaryTree node){
    indent  = indent.substring(3); 
    System.out.println(indent + "solvable(" +name(node) +") return true"); 
    return true; 
  } 

  static boolean no(Binarytree node){ 
    indent  = indent.substring(3); 
    System.out.println(indent + "solvable(" +name(node) +") return false"); 
    return false; 
  }
</pre>
<p>To use this code, we modify solvable as follows:</p>
<pre style="color: #007EB4;">
  static boolean solvable(BinaryTree node){ 
    enter(node); 
    if(node == null) return no(node);
    if(node.isGoalNode) return yes(node); 
    if(solvable(node.leftChild)) return yes(node); 
    if(solvable(node.rightChild)) return yes(node); 
    return no(node); 
  }
</pre>
<p>
  And we get these results: <br>
  Entering solvable(Root) <br>
  | Entering solvable(A) <br>
  | | Entering solvable(C) <br>
  | | | Entering solvable(null) <br>
  | | | solvable(null) returns false <br>
  | | | Entering solvable(null) <br>
  | | | solvable(null) returns false <br>
  | | solvable(C) returns false <br>

  <strong>Trick  #3: Never discard your debugging statements.</strong> <br><br>
  Writing debugging statements is programming too. Often it's as much work to debug the debugging statements as iy is to debug
  the actual program. Once your program is working, why throw this code away? <br><br>
  Obviously, you don't want to print out all this debugging information from a program you are ready to submit (or to turn over to yput manager).
   You could comment out your debugging calls, but that can be a lot of work. What's more, in the above example, you would have to replace every return(yes(nodel)) with return(true),
    and every return(no(nodel)) with return false. With all these changes, you might introduce new bugs into your program. <br><br>
  The simple solution is to make your debugging statements conditional For example. 
</p>
<pre style="color: #007EB4;">
  static final boolean debugging = false; 

  static void entry(BinaryTree node){
    if(debugging){
      System.out.println(indent + "Entering solvable(" + name(node) + ")"); 
      indent = indent + "| ";
    } 
  } 

  static boolean yes(BinaryTree node){
    if(debugging){ 
      indent = indent.substring(3); 
      System.out.println(indent + "solvable(" + name(node) + ") return true"); 
    } 
    return true; 
  } 

  static boolean yes(BinaryTree node){
    if(debugging){ 
      indent = indent.substring(3); 
      System.out.println(indent + "solvable(" + name(node) + ") return false"); 
    } 
    return false; 
  }
</pre>
<p>
  In industry, actual programs often have multiple flags to control different aspects of debugging.Don't worry too much about
  making your code larger; modern compilers will notice that since the variable debugging is final, it can never be true, and the controlled code will be discarded. <br><br>
  <strong>Trick #4: Create an Exception.</strong> <br><br>
  If an exception is thrown, you can get information about just where it happened by sending it the message printStackTrace(PrintStream). Since an Exception is an object like any other, you can create and throw your own Exceptions.
  However, Java programmers don't always realize that you can create an Exception without throwing it. for example, the following code. <br>
  <pre style="color: #007EB4;"> new Exception("Checkpoint Charlie").printStackTrace(System.out);</pre> 
  will print out a message something like this, and the program will then continue normally. That is, the above code just acts like a print statement.
  <pre style="color: #007EB4;">
    java.lang.Exception: Checkpoint Charlie

  <strong>Example: Cindy's Puzzle</strong><br><br>
  I call the following puzzle "Cindy's puzzle" for historical reasons. You have some numbers n of black marbles and the same number of white
  marbles, and you have a playing board which consist simply of a line of 2n+1 spaces to put the marbles is. Start with the black marbles all at 
  one end (say, the left), the white marbles all at the other end, and a free space in between.  <br>

<table border="2" cellpadding="5" style="background-color: #D8D8D8;">
  <tr>
    <td><img src="./Images/black-ball.png" alt="" ></td>
    <td><img src="./Images/black-ball.png" alt=""></td>

    <td><img src="./Images/white-ball.png" alt=""></td>
    <td><img src="./Images/white-ball.png" alt=""></td>
  </tr>
</table>
</center>
  
  <p>The goal is to reverse the positions of the marbles:</p>
  <center>
  <table border="2" cellpadding="5" style="background-color: #D8D8D8;">
    <tr>
      <td><img src="./Images/white-ball.png" alt=""></td>

      <td><img src="./Images/black-ball.png" alt=""></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</center>
  

  <p>
    <strong>The black marbles can only move to right, and the white marbles can only move to the left (no backing up). At each move, a marble can either:</strong> <br><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Move one space ahead, if that space is clear, or</li>
      <li>Jump ahead over exactly one marble of the opposite color, if the space just beyound that marble is clear.</li>
    </ul>
    <br> For example, you could make the following sequences of moves:

    The backtracking method is named solvable and returns a boolean. In solvable we shall need to check whether we are at a leaf,
    which in this case means a position from which no further moves are possible. This isn't so easy. <br><br>
    Now to the program. The main program will initialize the board, and call a recursive backtracking routine to attempt to solve the 
    puzzle. The backtracking routine will either succeed and print out a winning path, or it will fail, and the main program will have to print out the bad news. <br><br>
    The backtracking method is named solvable and returns a boolean. In solvable we shall need to check whether we are at a leaf which in this case means a position from which no further moves are possible. This isn't so easy. <br><br>
    Each possible move will result in a new board position, and these new board positions are children of the current board position. hence to find the children of a node, we need only find the possible moves from that node.
    Remember that it is also highly desirable to find an ordering on these possible moves. <br><br>
    Here it is time to stop and take thought. To make progress, we must analyze the game to some extent. Probably a number of approaches would work, and what follows is based on the way I worked it out. If you were to program this puzzle, you might find a different but equally valid approaches. <br><br>
    First, notice that if a marble has a move, that move is unique: if it can move ahead one square, then it cannot jump. If it can jump,
    it cannot move ahead one square. This suggests that, to find the possible moves, we might assign numbers to the marbles, and check each marble in turn. When we have looked at all the marbles, we have looked at all the possible moves. This would require having a table keep  
    track of where each marble is, or else somehow "marking" each marble with its number and searching the board each time to find the marble we want. Neither alternatives is vey attractive. <br><br>
    Next, notice that for a given board positon, each marble occupies a unique space. Hence, instead of talking about moving a particular marble, we can talk about moving the marble in a particular space. If a move is possible from a given space, then that must be the only move possible from that space, because 
    if the marble in that space has a move it is unique. There is a slight complication because not every space contains a marble, but at least the spaces (unlike the marbles) stay in one place. <br><br>
    <strong>Now we have a similiar ordering of moves to use in our program. Just check, in order, the 2n+1 spaces of the board. For each space, either zero or one moves is possible. With this understanding, we can write a boolean method canMove(int[] board, int poaition) which determines whether a move is possible from the given position:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>If the positon is empty no move is possible;</li>
      <li>If the positon contains a black marble, the method checks for a move or jump to the right;</li>
      <li>If the position contains the white marble, the method checks for a move or jump to the left.</li>
    </ul> 
    <p>We write method <strong>int[] makeMove(int[] oldBoard , int position)</strong> that will make a move from that positon, and return as its value a new board. (We could write this somewhat  more efficiently by changing the old board, rather than creating a new one, but here we are more concerned with simplicity). In technical jargon, makeMove is "applicative" rather than "mutative". <br><br>
      Along with <strong>canMove and makeMove,</strong> we are using methods <strong>puzzleSolved and printBoard</strong> with meanings that should be obvious.
    </p>
  </p>
  <pre style="color: #007EB4;"> 
    boolean solvable(int[] board){ 
      if(puzzleSolved(board)){
        return true; 
      } 
      for (int position = 0; position < BOARD_SIZE; position++){ 
        if(canMove(board, position)){
          int[] newBoard = makeMove(board , position); 
          if(solvable(newBoard)){ 
            printBoard(newBoard); 
            return true; 
          } 
        } 
      } 
      return false;
    }
  </pre>
  <p>
    Along with canMove and makeMove, we are using methods puzzleSolved and printBoard with meanings that should be obvious. <br><br>
    Here is some output from the program: 
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
      <strong>
      <li><i>16.</i> WHITE WHITE WHITE _____ BLACK BLACK BLACK</li>
      <li><i>15.</i> WHITE WHITE WHITE BLACK _____ BLACK BLACK</li>
      <li><i>14.</i> WHITE WHITE _____ BLACK WHITE BLACK BLACK</li>
      <li><i>13.</i> WHITE _____ WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK BLACK</li>
      <li><i>12.</i> WHITE BLACK WHITE _____ WHITE BLACK BLACK</li>
      <li><i>11.</i> WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE _____ BLACK</li>
      <li><i>10.</i> WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK _____</li>
      <li><i>9.</i> WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK _____ BLACK WHITE</li>
      <li><i>8.</i> WHITE BLACK _____ BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE</li>
      <li><i>7.</i> _____ BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE</li>
      <li><i>6.</i> BLACK _____ WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE</li>
      <li><i>5.</i> BLACK BLACK WHITE _____ WHITE BLACK WHITE</li>
      <li><i>4.</i> BLACK BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE _____ WHITE</li>
      <li><i>3.</i> BLACK BLACK WHITE BLACK _____ WHITE WHITE</li>
      <li><i>2.</i> BLACK BLACK _____ BLACK WHITE WHITE WHITE</li>
      <li><i>1.</i> BLACK BLACK BLACK _____ WHITE WHITE WHITE</li> 
    </strong>
    </ul></p>
   <p style="background-color: #D8D8D8;"> Notice that the solution is given in reverse order. BLACK starts out on the left and WHITE on the right, as in the last line. I've added line numbers to the actual output in order to emphasize this point. Backtracking always produces its results (sequence of choices) in reverse order; it is up to you, the programmer,
    to reverse the result aagain to get them in the correct order.
